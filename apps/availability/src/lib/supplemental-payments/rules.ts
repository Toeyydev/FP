// Supplemental guide payments — the rules, with no database and no network.
//
// A guide was paid for a job, and later an amount turns out to have been left out: a
// review incentive, a bonus, an adjustment. The payment that already went is closed — its
// transfer, slip, date and figures are history and stay exactly as they are. The missing
// amount becomes its OWN obligation here, and is paid by its own GuidePayment (kind
// SUPPLEMENTAL) through Payments v2 like any other transfer.
//
// Owner decisions (2026-10-01):
//   * A review incentive is additional compensation for how the tour was delivered (a
//     guest review). It is a COST OF SERVICES (ต้นทุนการให้บริการ), booked to REVIEW_REWARD —
//     PEAK 510110 ค่ารีวิวลูกค้า — kept apart from the guide fee for reporting. It is not a
//     reimbursement, not a company advance, and not a general marketing/promotion expense
//     (owner accounting policy, confirmed 2026-10-01).
//   * No withholding rate is assumed — not the guide fee's, not 3%. The rate comes from
//     configured accounting policy (SUPPLEMENTAL_WHT_PCT_<TYPE>, lib/supplemental-payments/
//     policy); with none configured the operator must enter it, and the row records which.
//   * Bonus, adjustment and other: their account is chosen explicitly; nothing guesses one.
//   * An earlier Bonus (FOLK-BNS, read-only history) still unpaid is converted into a
//     supplemental payment, once, for exactly its amount — never paid twice.
